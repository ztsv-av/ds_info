# Production Cycle

1. Project scoping: A project starts with scoping the project, laying out goals & objectives, constraints, and evaluation criteria. Stakeholders should be identified and involved. Resources should be estimated and allocated.
2. Data management: Data used and generated by ML systems can be large and diverse, which requires scalable infrastructure to process and access it fast and reliably. Data management covers data sources, data formats, data processing, data control, data storage, etc.
3. ML model development: From raw data, you need to create training datasets and possibly label them, then generate features, train models, optimize models, and evaluate them. This is the stage that requires the most ML knowledge and is most often covered in ML courses.
4. Deployment: After a model is developed, it needs to be made accessible to users.
5. Monitoring and maintenance: Once in production, models need to be monitored for performance decay and maintained/updated to be adaptive to changing environments and changing requirements.
6. Business analysis: Model performance needs to be evaluated against business goals and analyzed to generate business insights. These insights can then be used to eliminate unproductive projects or scope out new projects.

# Shared Computer Science and Data Science Knowledge Base

This repository is a continuously growing collection of notes, explanations, code snippets, and reference material gathered throughout academic studies and professional work in computer science, data science, and machine learning.

Unlike course-specific repositories, this project is intentionally unstructured and evolving. The goal is to serve as a shared knowledge base that can be extended, corrected, and improved collaboratively.

## Purpose

The main objectives of this repository are:

- Centralize technical knowledge collected over time
- Provide concise explanations of core concepts
- Serve as a practical reference for interviews, revision, and applied work
- Allow multiple contributors to add, refine, and update content

This repository is open to collaboration and does not follow a strict curriculum or ordering.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized loosely by topic rather than by course or semester.

### Computer Science

Contains material related to core computer science topics, including:

- Algorithms and data structures
- Object-oriented design and methods
- Operating systems and parallel computing
- Software development, requirements, and security
- Networking, hardware, Linux, SQL, and UI design

### Machine Learning

Contains theoretical and practical material related to machine learning and artificial intelligence, including:

- Core ML concepts and terminology
- Optimization methods, loss functions, and learning rates
- Neural networks, CNNs, transformers, and autoencoders
- Supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning
- Model evaluation, debugging, and diagnostics
- Code examples and experimental scripts

### Mathematics

Contains mathematical foundations relevant to data science and machine learning, including:

- Probability theory
- Statistics and time series concepts
- Linear algebra and calculus
- Convexity, optimization, and notation references

### Interviews

Contains preparation material for technical interviews, including:

- Theory summaries
- Practice questions
- Concept refreshers

## Contribution Guidelines

This repository is designed to be collaborative.

Contributions are welcome in the form of:

- New notes or explanations
- Corrections or clarifications
- Additional examples or code
- Reorganization where it improves clarity

There is no strict format requirement. Clarity and correctness are preferred over polish.
